# Signals Library: Development Roadmap

## Philosophy

We've built a solid foundation for fine-grained reactive programming in Zig. Now it's time to polish, harden, and expand this library to serve the broader Zig ecosystem. We focus on developer experience, performance, and reliability above all else.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Developer Experience First**: The API should be intuitive, well-documented, and a joy to use
2. **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: Leverage Zig's compile-time capabilities for maximum performance
3. **Memory Safety**: Explicit memory management with excellent debugging support
4. **Composability**: Build a foundation that others can extend and build upon
5. **Real-World Tested**: Ensure the library works in production scenarios

## Phase 1: Library Hardening (Current - 2 weeks)

**Goal:** Create a production-ready, reliable signals library that can be safely used in real applications.

**Core Stability:**
- âœ… Comprehensive test suite with DebugAllocator integration
- âœ… Memory leak detection and proper cleanup
- âœ… Edge case handling for complex dependency graphs
- ðŸ”„ Error handling patterns and recovery strategies
- ðŸ”„ Performance benchmarks and optimization

**Documentation & Examples:**
- ðŸ”„ Complete API documentation with examples
- ðŸ”„ Tutorial-style examples for different use cases
- ðŸ”„ Performance characteristics documentation
- ðŸ”„ Migration guide for different reactive patterns

**Build System:**
- âœ… Static library build configuration
- âœ… Test runner integration
- ðŸ”„ Package preparation for distribution
- ðŸ”„ CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

## Phase 2: API Expansion (2-3 weeks)

**Goal:** Add commonly needed reactive primitives and utilities.

**Advanced Primitives:**
- **Batch Updates**: Ability to batch multiple signal updates to prevent cascading effects
- **Computed Signals**: Alternative memo syntax for simpler derived values  
- **Signal Arrays**: Efficient handling of collections of reactive values
- **Conditional Effects**: Effects that can be conditionally enabled/disabled

**Utilities:**
- **Debug Tools**: Runtime inspection of dependency graphs
- **Performance Profiler**: Track update propagation and performance bottlenecks
- **Testing Utilities**: Helpers for testing reactive code

**Integration Helpers:**
- **Async Bridge**: Integration with Zig's async/await for async effects
- **Event Loop Integration**: Helpers for integrating with event loops
- **Serialization**: Safe serialization/deserialization of signal state

## Phase 3: Ecosystem Integration (3-4 weeks)

**Goal:** Position the library as a foundational piece of the Zig ecosystem.

**Package Distribution:**
- Package manager integration (when available)
- Version management and semantic versioning
- Comprehensive release notes and migration guides

**Community Building:**
- Example applications showcasing different use cases
- Blog posts and tutorials
- Integration examples with popular Zig libraries

**Real-World Validation:**
- Use the library in a non-trivial application
- Gather feedback from early adopters
- Performance testing in production-like scenarios

## Phase 4: Advanced Features (Future)

**Goal:** Add sophisticated features for complex use cases.

**Potential Extensions:**
- **Signals Query**: TanStack Query-like functionality for async state management
- **Time-Based Signals**: Signals that automatically update based on time
- **Network-Aware Signals**: Signals that can synchronize across network boundaries
- **Persistence Layer**: Automatic persistence and restoration of signal state
- **DevTools**: Browser-like debugging tools for signal dependency graphs

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption**: Other Zig projects using the library as a dependency
- **Stability**: Zero memory leaks or crashes in production use
- **Performance**: Competitive with hand-written reactive code
- **Developer Experience**: Positive feedback from the community
- **Documentation**: Complete, accurate, and helpful documentation
